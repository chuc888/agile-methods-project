   Species Data
   ----------------------------------
   Data only. Pages that render animals
   (detail page, animal cards) read from
   ANIMALS and must not hardcode content.

   To add a species: add one object to
   ANIMALS. Its "id" becomes the profile
   URL: animal.html?id=<id>

   Field notes:
   - status: global IUCN Red List category.
   - population: optional. Always dated;
     estimates go stale, so re-check them.
   - image.src: null until a team-owned or
     properly licensed photo is available.
     Every photo needs credit, license,
     licenseUrl, and sourceUrl. Check each
     Wikimedia Commons file's own license.
   - ecologicalImportance: cited explanation of the species’ ecological role.
   - protectionActions: cited actions accessible to Pittsburgh residents.
   - sources: each fact lists the ids of
     the sources that support it.
